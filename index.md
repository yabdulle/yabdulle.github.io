## About Me
---
Hey there, welcome! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, part of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London. 


## Research Interests
---
Primary Research Area:
- My PhD thesis is focusing on the development and training of a multimodal AI model to predict individuals at risk of ALS/MND. 


Other Research Areas:
- ðŸ’» Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction in Medical Imaging: Explored methods for improving chest X-ray analysis by incorporating vision and language models with eye gaze patterns.
- ðŸ§  User Experience and Assistive Technologies in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Investigated neck collar preferences and user experiences in motor neuron disease through a survey-based study. Explored the suitability of current outcome measures for neck collars in motor neuron disease.
- ðŸ“Š Biomedical Knowledge Curation: Worked on a scoping review to explore the applications of knowledge graphs in biomedical and healthcare sciences. Worked on research benchmarking and analyzing in-context learning, fine-tuning, and supervised learning for biomedical knowledge curation, with a focus on chemical entities of biological interest (CHeBI).
