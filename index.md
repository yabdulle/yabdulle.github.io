## About Me
---
Hey there, welcome! I'm currently a Research Assistant at the Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, where I am part of the [KnowLab](https://knowlab.github.io/), a research group that works on AI in Healthcare.


## Research Interests
---
Primary Research Area:
- I'm working on using Knowledge Graphs and Graph Machine Learning for early diagnosis and of rare neurodegenerative diseases.


Other Research Areas:
- ðŸ’» Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction in Medical Imaging: Explored methods for improving chest X-ray analysis by incorporating vision and language models with eye gaze patterns.
- ðŸ§  User Experience and Assistive Technologies in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Investigated neck collar preferences and user experiences in motor neuron disease through a survey-based study. Explored the suitability of current outcome measures for neck collars in motor neuron disease.
- ðŸ“Š Biomedical Knowledge Curation: Worked on a scoping review to explore the applications of knowledge graphs in biomedical and healthcare sciences. Worked on research benchmarking and analyzing in-context learning, fine-tuning, and supervised learning for biomedical knowledge curation, with a focus on chemical entities of biological interest (CHeBI). 
-  ðŸ“– Assiting on a systematic review on "[Peripheral and CSF inflammatory markers in individuals with ALS and FTD](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=212528)"
