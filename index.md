## About Me
---
Hey there, welcome! I'm currently a Research Assistant at the Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, where I am part of the [KnowLab](https://knowlab.github.io/), a research group that works on AI in Healthcare.

Prior to this role, I served as a Data Scientist at a TechBio startup, Research Assistant @ UCL Institute of Neurology and as a Clinical Research Assistant working on the COVID-19 vaccine trials @ the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust. My educational background includes a Master's degree in Clinical Neuroscience from University College London and a Bachelor's degree with First Class Honours in Biomedical Science from the University of Brighton.

## Research Interests
---
My research interests are at the intersection of health and data science, particularly in deep learning techniques. Currently, my work is focused on these following areas:

* Exploring the application of Knowledge Graphs and Graph Neural Networks in rare neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and prognosis.
* Conducting a systematic review on "[Peripheral and CSF inflammatory markers in individuals with ALS and FTD](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=212528)"
